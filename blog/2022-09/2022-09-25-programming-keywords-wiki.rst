* `Control flow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow>`_ (flow of control):

    is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imparative program are executed or evaluated.

* `programming paradigm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm>`_:

    a way to classify programming languages based on their features. common paradigms include:
        * imperative programming
            * procedural
            * object-oriented
        * declarative programming
            * functional
            * logic
            * mathematical
            * reactive

* `imperative programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming>`_:

    a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state. programmer instructs the machine how to change its state.

* `declarative programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming>`_:

    a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. e.g. (database query languages, regex, etc). the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.

* `software framework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework>`_:

    is an abstraction in which software can be selectively changed by additional user-written code. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software .

        * inversion of control

        * default behaviour

        * extensibility

        * non-modifiable framework code

* inversion of control:

    a programming principle, where custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework

* dependency inversion principle:

    is a specific methodology

    * High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).

    * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions

* dependency injection:

    a design pattern that achieves inversion of control via a container type of implementation

* `microframework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microframework>`_: minimal web application framework, in contrast with full-stack framework.

* `web application framework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework>`_: a software framework that is designed to support the dev of web applications including web services, web resources and web apis.
